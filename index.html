<h3>Did you know that 90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years? </h3>
<h3>Around the world, companys and organizations are creating more data every day, yet most are struggling to benefit from it. The US alone will face a shortage of 150,000+ data analysts and an additional 1.5 million data-savvy managers.

<h2> "Data is the new Oil" -Ann Winblad </h3>
<h3>We are in a digital economy where data is more valuable than ever. It is the key to the smooth functionality of everything from the government to local companies. When your business is growing, more and more people have opinions about which steps need to be taken. It helps to work with a 'good data beats opinion' philosophy. Almost everything can be tested, measured and improved. If you can measure it, you can improve it. </h3>
